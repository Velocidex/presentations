       ## Overview
       
       There is no way we can cover all of the capabilities Velociraptor offers in the time today!
       
       * This workshop will give a taste to how modern threat hunting is done
         at scale
       * We will look at some of the common scenarios and attacks and some of
         the modern detection techniques we can employ to find these.
       * This workshop will be a "Follow Along" workshop - please try these
         exercises on your own machine!

       ## What is Velociraptor?
       * Velociraptor is a unique Free and Open Source DFIR tool, giving you
         power and flexibility through the Velociraptor Query Language
       * VQL is used to drive a powerful set of forensic capabilities:
       * Using VQL we can write custom "Artifacts" to identify emerging threats quickly and safely
       * Hunt for artifacts at scale over thousands of end points within
         minutes!

       ## Deployment overview
       ![](https://github.com/Velocidex/presentations/blob/master//modules/overview/deployment_overview.svg?raw=true)
   - type: markdown
     template: |
       <!-- .slide: class="content" -->
       ## Typical deployments
       
       * Support Linux, Windows, MacOS, FreeBSD …
       * Server simply collects the results of queries - clients do all the heavy lifting.
       * Client memory and CPU usage is controlled via throttling and active cancellations.
       * Server is optimized for speed and scalability
       * Concurrency control ensures stability
       * Bandwidth limits ensure network stability
   - type: markdown
     template: |
       <!-- .slide: class="content" -->
       ## Typical deployments
       
       Current recommendations
       * 10k-15k clients - single server with file based data store (usually cloud VM).
       * SSL load is the biggest load - TLS offloading helps a lot!
       * 8 GB RAM/8 cores is generous towards the top of the range.
       * We recommend Ubuntu/Debian server
           * 15-20k to 150k endpoints we recommend a multi-frontend setup.

       ## Create a local server
       
       * Create a local server on your windows system.
       * We will use this server's notebook feature to learn about windows artifacts
       * Run Velociraptor on your machine
           * Download Velociraptor from GitHub (.msi or .exe)
       
       ```
       velociraptor-v0.72.3-windows-amd64.exe gui
       ```
   - type: markdown
     template: |
       <!-- .slide: class="full_screen_diagram" -->
       
       The "gui" command creates an instant temporary server/client with self
         signed SSL and a hard coded admin/password.

       ## The Dashboard
       
       * The Dashboard shows the current state of the installation:
           * How many clients are connected
           * Current CPU load and memory footprint on the server.
           * When running hunts or intensive processing, memory and CPU requirements will increase but not too much.
           * You can customize the dashboard - it’s also just an artifact.

       <!-- .slide: class="content small-font" -->
       ## Searching for a client
       
       To work with a specific client we need to search for it.  Press the
       **Search** or **Show All** button to see some clients. You can also
       use the **Show recent hosts** to see your own clients.

       <!-- .slide: class="content" -->
       ## Search for clients
       
       ### hostname, label, or client ID.
       
       * You can start typing the hostname to auto-complete
       * Some common terms:
          * `host`: search by hostnames
          * `mac`: Mac addresses
          * `ip`: last seen IP address
          * `label`: Search by labels

     template: |
       <!-- .slide: class="content small-font" -->
       ## Client Overview
       
       * Internally the client id is considered the most accurate source of
       endpoint identity

       <!-- .slide: class="content small-font" -->
       ## Shell commands
       
       * Velociraptor allows running shell commands on the endpoint using
         `Powershell`/`Cmd`/`Bash`
           * Only Velociraptor users with the administrator role are allowed to
         do this!
           * Actions are logged and audited
       
       ```powershell
       Get-LocalGroupMember -Group "Administrators"
       ```

       ## The VFS View
       
       Remember that the VFS view is simply a server side cache of
       information we know about the endpoint - it is usually out of date!
       
       ![](https://github.com/Velocidex/presentations/blob/master//modules/gui_tour/vfs_view.png?raw=true)

       <!-- .slide: class="content small-font" -->
       ## Navigating the interface
       
       * Click the “Refresh this directory” will schedule a directory listing
         artifact and wait for the results (usually very quick if the
         endpoint is online).
       * The “Recursively refresh this directory” will schedule a recursive
         refresh - this may take some time! After this operation a lot of the
         VFS will be pre-populated already.
       * “Collect from client” will retrieve the file data to the
         server. After which, the floppy disk sign indicates that we have
         file data available and you can click the “Download” link to get a
         copy of the file.

       ## Previewing files
       
       The GUI allows close inpection of binary files
       * Viewing in hex or text
       * Paging - skipping to offset
       * Searching using regex or hex strings

       ## Why a query language?
       * Able to dynamically adapt to changing requirements - without needing to rebuild clients or servers.
       * For example, a new IOC is released for detection of a specific threat
           * Immediately write a VQL artifact for the threat, upload the artifact and hunt everywhere for it.
           * Turn around from IOC to full hunt: A few minutes.
           * Share artifacts with the community
       * VQL Artifacts are simply YAML files with VQL queries.
           * Can be easily shared and cross pollinate other Artifacts
           * Can be customized by callers.
           * [Public Artifact Reference](https://docs.velociraptor.app/artifact_references/)

       ## What is VQL?
       
       ```sql
       SELECT X, Y, Z FROM plugin(arg=1) WHERE X = 1
       ```
       
       * `X, Y, Z` are called Column Selectors
       * `plugin(arg=1)` is termed a VQL Plugin with Args
       * `X = 1` is the Filter Condition

       <!-- .slide: class="content" -->
       ## Velociraptor artifacts
       
       Velociraptor is just a VQL engine!
       
       * We package VQL queries in Artifacts:
           * YAML files
           * Include human description
           * Package related VQL queries into “Sources”
           * Take parameters for customization
           * Can in turn be used in VQL as well...
   - type: markdown

       <!-- .slide: class="content" -->
       
       ## What does the VFS view do under the cover?
       
       * Refreshing the VFS simply schedules new artifacts to be collected - it is just a GUI convenience.

       ## Velociraptor uses expert knowledge
       
       A key objective of Velociraptor is encapsulating DFIR knowledge into
       the platform, so you don’t need to be a DFIR expert.  We have high
       level questions to answer We know where to look for evidence of user /
       system activities
       
       We build artifacts to collect and analyze the evidence in order to answer our investigative questions.

       ## Configuring the artifact collection
       
       * Many artifacts take parameters that can control the way they work.

       ## Configuring collection resource limits
       
       There are many safety limits implemented into the client to control endpoint impact.

       <!-- .slide: class="content small-font" -->
       ## What do artifacts return?
       
       * All artifacts produce rows since they are just queries.
       * Some artifacts also upload files. You can create a download zip to export all the uploaded files.

       ## VQL - Velociraptor's magic sauce
       
       Rather than having specific analysis modules, VQL allows generic capabilities to be combined in novel creative ways
       * NTFS/MFT/USN/Glob file system analysis
       * File parsers - Grok, Sqlite etc
       * Built in powerful parser framework for novel binary parsers

       ## Velociraptor Artifacts
       Velociraptor comes with a large number of artifact types
       * Client Artifacts run on the endpoint
       * Client Event artifacts monitor the endpoint
       * Server Artifacts run on the server
       * Server Event artifacts monitor for events on the server.

       ## Velociraptor Query Language
       
       Using a query language we can string together different forensic
       capabilities to create novel analysis
       
       The Power of Open source!
       
       The [Velociraptor artifact

       ## Finding files
       
       DFIR is often about finding files on the endpoint
       * Filename is sometimes an indicator
       * Word documents in a temp folder may contain macros
       * Sometimes we need to filter by file content
       * File has signature of malicious macro/script

       ## The Windows Registry
       
       * Windows uses the registry to store configuration data.
       * Many attackers modify system configuration to achieve persistence
       * It is very useful to be able to query the registry!
       * Velociraptor has two types of registry accessors:
           * "registry" uses the APIs
           * "raw_reg" parses the registry hives themselves

       ## Example: Disable event logs
       
       * Windows event logs are crucial for detection
       * Many detection solutions rely on forwarding event logs to a backend
       * It is trivial to enable/disable event log collection
       * Let's look at disabling the BITS client events

       ## Hunting - mass collections
       
       Hunting is Velociraptor's strength - collect the same artifact from thousands of endpoints in minutes!
       
       * Two types of hunts:
          * Detection hunts are very targeted aimed at yes/no answer
          * Collection hunts collect a lot more data and can be used to
            build a baseline.

       ## Exercise - baseline event logs
       
       For this exercise we start a few more clients.
       
       ```text
       c:\Users\test>cd c:\Users\test\AppData\Local\Temp\
       
       c:\Users\test\AppData\Local\Temp>Velociraptor.exe
          --config client.config.yaml pool_client --number 100
       ```
       
       This starts 100 virtual clients so we can hunt them
       * We use pool clients to simulate load on the server

       * The previous collection may be considered the baseline
       * For this exercise we want to create a few different clients.
           * Stop the pool client
           * Disable a log channel
           * Start the pool client with an additional number of clients

       ## NTFS Overview
       
       * NTFS is the file system in all modern Windows operating systems.
       * Feature packed with a design focused on storage optimization and resilience.
       * NTFS implements Journalling to record metadata changes to track state and integrity of the file system.
       * Allows for recovery after system crashes to avoid data loss
       * File System objects referenced in a Master File Table (MFT)
   - type: markdown
     template: |
       <!-- .slide: class="content" -->
       ## New Technology File System
       
       * In NTFS, the Master File Table (MFT) is at the heart of the file
         system. A structured database that stores metadata entries for every
         file and folder.
       * Every object gets an entry within the MFT. Each entry is usually
         1024 bytes long.  Contains a series of attributes that fully
         describe the object.

     template: |
       <!-- .slide: class="content" -->

       ## NTFS Analysis
       
       Velociraptor offers a number of plugins to access detailed information
       about NTFS:
       * `parse_mft()`: parses each MFT entry and returns high level metadata
         about the entry - including reconstruct the full path of the entry
         by traversing parent MFT entries.
       * `parse_ntfs()`: Given an MFT ID this function will display
         information about the various streams (e.g. `$DATA`, `$Filename`
         etc)
       * `parse_ntfs_i30()`: This scans the `$i30` stream in directories to
         recover potentially deleted entries.

       ## Finding suspicious files
       
       Parse the MFT using `Windows.NTFS.MFT`
       
       * Common DFIR use case is finding files
           * File name
           * Path
           * File type
           * Content

       Compress-Archive -Path C:\PerfLogs\* -DestinationPath C:\PerfLogs\exfil.zip -CompressionLevel Fastest
       
       ## 6. Delete dmp,zip and ps1 files - deleted file discovery is important for later!
       Remove-Item -Path C:\PerfLogs\*.zip, C:\PerfLogs\*.dmp, C:\PerfLogs\*.ps1
       ```

       Note:
       
       Adversaries may use MSBuild to proxy execution of code through a
       trusted Windows utility. MSBuild.exe (Microsoft Build Engine) is a
       software build platform used by Visual Studio. It handles XML
       formatted project files that define requirements for loading and
       building various platforms and configurations.[1]
       
       Adversaries can abuse MSBuild to proxy execution of malicious
       code. The inline task capability of MSBuild that was introduced in
       .NET version 4 allows for C# or Visual Basic code to be inserted into
       an XML project file.[1][2] MSBuild will compile and execute the inline
       task. MSBuild.exe is a signed Microsoft binary, so when it is used
       this way it can execute arbitrary code and bypass application control
       defenses that are configured to allow MSBuild.exe execution.[3]

     template: |
       <!-- .slide: class="content" -->
       ## What is the point of Forensics?
       
       * Forensics is used to reconstruct past events from artifacts left on
         the system.
       * We are at the mercy of lucky accidents and side effects of system
         behavior!
       * When Velociraptor is running permanently on the endpoint, we can
         deliberately monitor the endpoint and record a more accurate
         timeline of events!

     template: |
       <!-- .slide: class="content" -->
       ## Tracking processes
       
       * One of the critical questions we ask is `Where did this process come
         from?`
       
       * Context of where the process came from is important in establishing
         initial access vector!
       
       * We could collect all process execution from all endpoints, but:
           * This will generate a large volume of events.
           * Vast majority of events are not interesting.
           * Often we determine which process is interesting is determined by
             context.
   - type: markdown
     template: |
       <!-- .slide: class="content" -->
       ## The process tracker
       
       * Velociraptor can track processes locally on the endpoint at runtime.
       * If the need arises, we can enrich with process execution information.
       * This can be done **EVEN IF THE PROCESS EXITED**

       ## How does ETW work ?
       
       * Various software packages throughout the Operating System register themselves as an Event Provider using a unique GUID
       * As the software operates, various logging points within the code send "Events" to the provider.
       * The operating system simply matches consumers with providers
       * A consumer registers interest in a particular provider using the GUID
       * Note that if no consumers are interested ETW logging points are essentially free.

       <!-- .slide: class="content" -->
       ## ETW Providers
       
       * Any software can define an ETW provider
       * There is no consistency - some providers are detailed - some not
       * Discoverability is an issue! Some providers are less documented
       * It is sometimes possible to infer a lot of providers from their manifest files.
       * There are some public efforts to better document the available providers.

       ## Monitoring the ETW stream
       
       * As an example, we will illustrate how to follow an ETW stream with
         the `watch_etw()` plugin.
       
       * VQL allows Velociraptor to attach to an ETW stream and filter,
       enrich or respond to events directly on the endpoint.
       
       * We can use [WEP
       Explorer](https://github.com/lallousx86/WinTools/tree/master/WEPExplorer)
       to explore interesting sources of ETW events.

       ## Unique ETW sources: Process parent spoofing
       
       * ETW can provide information that is not normally available - for
         example reliable process parent/child relationships.
       * Many detections rely on parent/child relationships
       * The Windows CreateProcess() API allows the caller to specify the
         parent of a process.
       * This means it is trivial to spoof the parent process without any
         privileges - this is a very effective way to defeat parent/child
         based detections.

       ## What did we not cover?
       
       * Velociraptor has a lot more than we were able to cover here:
       * Many more sources of data: Event logs, ETW, WMI eventing
       * Multi-Platform: Linux, MacOS, Windows, FreeBSD
       * Endpoint monitoring in real time: Detect and identify compromises in real time!
       * Automatic remediation: Apply active remediation to remove the driver and ensure all endpoints are clean.
       * Server automation and monitoring in real time with a python API.

       ## Conclusions
       
       * In this workshop we introduced Velociraptor - a powerful endpoint
         visibility solution, as used in a typical DFIR exercise.
       
       * We introduced VQL and gave some examples…
           * Searching for files,
           * registry keys and other endpoint state Hunting everywhere
