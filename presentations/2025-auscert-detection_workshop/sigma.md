## Sigma Rules

* A Sigma rule specifies how to detect a particular attack
   * Think of it as **grep** for event logs


* Vibe detection
   * *logsource* section specifies an event source to match the rule against.
   * *detection* clause contains a list of `selections` joined into a logical `condition`.
   * *condition* clause specifies how to combine the detection clauses logically.
   * Selections refer to abstract fields that map to actual fields
     within the event. These mappings are called `Field Mappings`.

## Sigma Rules

* The Sigma standard does not define
   * What log sources are actually available
   * The specific structure of each event
   * What fields are available and what they are called.

* The intention is to convey the "vibe" of a detection.
   * A Sigma Compiler for the target SIEM is used to convert this
     "vibe" to a concrete detection for a particular engine.

## Sigma Rule Syntax

* Covered in details [in the Sigma HQ documentation site](https://sigmahq.io/docs/basics/rules.html)
    * Based on YAML
* Detections are written in YAML
    * Include Selections and Condition clause
    * Selections can be OR or AND
    * Condition combine selection logically

```
detection:
  selection_and:
    displaymessage: Max sign in attempts exceeded
  selection_or:
    field_name:
      - this # or
      - that
  condition: selection_and and selection_or
```

## Sigma Rule Syntax

* Modifiers apply to the field to allow transformation for matching.
* Although it looks like they can be applied in any order, only a few
  combinations make sense.
* Velociraptor `vql` modifier allows running arbitrary VQL code on a field.

```
detection:
  selection:
     - TargetFilename|endswith: '.cmdline'
     - fieldname|base64offset|contains:
         - /bin/bash
     - fieldname|contains: needle
     - fieldname|re: .*needle$
     - fieldname|startswith: needle
     - EventData|vql:
         x=>hash(path=x.Filename).MD5 =~ '12345'
```

## The Sigma Model

### Converting a Vibe to a concrete detection

* To convert a Sigma rule to a concrete detection
    * **Field Mappings**: Mapping between abstract field names and
      concrete field names.

    * **Log sources**: Mapping between abstract log source
      specification and concrete data sources.

    * Code to convert the conditional logical clauses to platform
      specific query against the backend.

* This is done by the Sigma Compiler for the target.
    * e.g. for Elastic

## The Sigma Model

### Converting a Vibe to a concrete detection

* It generally does not make sense to speak of a `Sigma Rule` without
  knowing the exact `model` used.

* The Sigma standard is not really portable, only the Vibe is
  portable.

  * When converting rules from one model, it helps to develop a new
    model with a 1:1 mappings.

  * For example, a Velociraptor Model to consume Sigma Rules written
    for the ECS stack.

## The Velociraptor Sigma Architecture

* Velociraptor has a built in Sigma engine
    * Sigma is the preferred built in method for scalable detection and triaging!
* Accepts a model definition:
    * Log sources are VQL queries that generate events
    * Field mappings are VQL Lambda functions that resolve fields in the rule.
* Velociraptor terminology
    * `Sigma Model` == `Sigma Compiler`
* Rules and Models are pushed to the endpoint for direct evaluation
* Only Matches are forwarded to the server.

## The Velociraptor Curated Sigma Project

* A Project to maintain and curate:

   * Useful set of `Sigma Models` for different situations
   * A Curated set of `Sigma Rules` tailored for use in the models.

* Main goal is to separate the `maintainance of the Model` and the
  `writing of the rules`!

## The Windows Base Model

* Most public Sigma Rules address Windows Event Logs
* Designed to be compatible with Sigma Rules in the wild.
    * Usually this model will work with most Sigma Rules out there.
    * Log sources are compatible with [Sigma HQ](https://sigmahq.io/docs/basics/log-sources.html) Windows Event Logs
* This Sigma Model is used by the `Windows.Hayabusa.Rules` artifact
    * Many projects out there use a similar model (e.g. `Hayabusa`,
      `ChainSaw` etc).
    * This model defines

## Recap: Sigma traps

* You can not just blindly copy Sigma Rules from one system to another
* You have to carefully check that the sigma models are compatible
   * Log sources refer to the same events
   * Field mappings have corresponding mappings in the two models.

* E.g. Sigma rules written for Sysmon EID 1 can not be reliably used
  by Windows Audit EID 4688
