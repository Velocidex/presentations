## Conclusions
### What have we learned?

* Detection engineering is an exciting field of Cyber Security
    * More than just typing queries into the SIEM!
* Thinking about improving odds of detection strategically
    * Has an engineering and design component.

## Conclusions

* Attackers can change their attack to subvert detection!
* Perfect is the enemy of the good!
   * Detections do not have to be perfect!
   * Different detections can cover off on each other
   * By adding a lot of different detections it makes it very
     difficult to bypass.

 > We only need one rule to hit for the adversaries to have a bad day!
