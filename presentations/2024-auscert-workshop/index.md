## What did we not cover?

* Velociraptor has a lot more than we were able to cover here:
* Many more sources of data: Event logs, ETW, WMI eventing
* Multi-Platform: Linux, MacOS, Windows, FreeBSD
* Endpoint monitoring in real time: Detect and identify compromises in real time!
* Automatic remediation: Apply active remediation to remove the driver and ensure all endpoints are clean.
* Server automation and monitoring in real time with a python API.

## Conclusions

* In this workshop we introduced Velociraptor - a powerful endpoint
  visibility solution, as used in a typical DFIR exercise.

* We introduced VQL and gave some examples…
    * Searching for files,
    * registry keys and other endpoint state Hunting everywhere
