## Typical deployments

Current recommendations
* 10k-15k clients - single server with file based data store (usually cloud VM).
* SSL load is the biggest load - TLS offloading helps a lot!
* 8 GB RAM/8 cores is generous towards the top of the range.
* We recommend Ubuntu/Debian server
    * 15-20k to 150k endpoints we recommend a multi-frontend setup.
