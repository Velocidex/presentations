## VQL - Velociraptor's magic sauce

Rather than having specific analysis modules, VQL allows generic capabilities to be combined in novel creative ways
* NTFS/MFT/USN/Glob file system analysis
* File parsers - Grok, Sqlite etc
* Built in powerful parser framework for novel binary parsers

## Velociraptor Query Language

Using a query language we can string together different forensic
capabilities to create novel analysis

The Power of Open source!

The [Velociraptor artifact
exchange](https://docs.velociraptor.app/exchange/) is a place for the
community to publish useful VQL artifacts for reuse

## Finding files

DFIR is often about finding files on the endpoint
* Filename is sometimes an indicator
* Word documents in a temp folder may contain macros
* Sometimes we need to filter by file content
* File has signature of malicious macro/script
