## What is Velociraptor?
* Velociraptor is a unique Free and Open Source DFIR tool, giving you
  power and flexibility through the Velociraptor Query Language
* VQL is used to drive a powerful set of forensic capabilities:
* Using VQL we can write custom "Artifacts" to identify emerging threats quickly and safely
* Hunt for artifacts at scale over thousands of end points within
  minutes!

## Deployment overview
![](../../modules/overview/deployment_overview.svg)

---


<!-- .slide: class="content" -->
## Typical deployments

* Support Linux, Windows, MacOS, FreeBSD …
* Server simply collects the results of queries - clients do all the heavy lifting.
* Client memory and CPU usage is controlled via throttling and active cancellations.
* Server is optimized for speed and scalability
* Concurrency control ensures stability
* Bandwidth limits ensure network stability

---


<!-- .slide: class="content" -->
## Typical deployments

Current recommendations
* 10k-15k clients - single server with file based data store (usually cloud VM).
* SSL load is the biggest load - TLS offloading helps a lot!
* 8 GB RAM/8 cores is generous towards the top of the range.
* We recommend Ubuntu/Debian server
    * 15-20k to 150k endpoints we recommend a multi-frontend setup.

# Velociraptor Installation and GUI tour

---


<!-- .slide: class="content" -->
## Create a local server

* Create a local server on your windows system.
* We will use this server's notebook feature to learn about windows artifacts
* Run Velociraptor on your machine
    * Download Velociraptor from GitHub (.msi or .exe)

```
velociraptor-v0.6.6-2-windows-amd64.exe gui
```

---


<!-- .slide: class="full_screen_diagram" -->

The "gui" command creates an instant temporary server/client with self
  signed SSL and a hard coded admin/password.

![](../../modules/gui_tour/velociraptor-gui.png)

---

<!-- .slide: class="full_screen_diagram" -->
## Your Velociraptor is ready to use!

![](../../modules/gui_tour/GUI.png)
---

<!-- .slide: class="title" -->
# A Velociraptor GUI tour

<img src="../../modules/gui_tour/tour-bus.png" class="title-inset">

---

<!-- .slide: class="content" -->

## The Dashboard

* The Dashboard shows the current state of the installation:
    * How many clients are connected
    * Current CPU load and memory footprint on the server.
    * When running hunts or intensive processing, memory and CPU requirements will increase but not too much.
    * You can customize the dashboard - it’s also just an artifact.

---

<!-- .slide: class="full_screen_diagram" -->

## The Dashboard

![](../../modules/gui_tour/dashboard.png)

---

<!-- .slide: class="content" -->
## User Preferences

You can customize the interface to your liking


<div class="container small-font">
<div class="col">

* Themes

</div>
<div class="col">

* Languages
* Timezones

</div>
</div>

<img src="../../modules/gui_tour/user_preferences.png" style="bottom: inherit" class="" />

---

<!-- .slide: class="title" -->

# Interactively investigate individual clients

---


<!-- .slide: class="content small-font" -->
## Searching for a client

To work with a specific client we need to search for it.  Press the
**Search** or **Show All** button to see some clients. You can also
use the **Show recent hosts** to see your own clients.

![](../../modules/gui_tour/search_clients.png)

---

<!-- .slide: class="content" -->
## Search for clients

### hostname, label, or client ID.

* You can start typing the hostname to auto-complete
* Some common terms:
   * `host`: search by hostnames
   * `mac`: Mac addresses
   * `ip`: last seen IP address
   * `label`: Search by labels

---


<!-- .slide: class="content small-font" -->
## Client Overview

* Internally the client id is considered the most accurate source of
endpoint identity

![](../../modules/gui_tour/client_overview.png)

---

<!-- .slide: class="content small-font" -->
## Shell commands

* Velociraptor allows running shell commands on the endpoint using
  `Powershell`/`Cmd`/`Bash`
    * Only Velociraptor users with the administrator role are allowed to
  do this!
    * Actions are logged and audited

```powershell
Get-LocalGroupMember -Group "Administrators"
```

![](../../modules/gui_tour/shell_commands.png)

---

<!-- .slide: class="title" -->
# Interactively fetching files from the endpoint

<img src="../../modules/gui_tour/fetch.png" class="title-inset">

---

<!-- .slide: class="content small-font" -->
## The VFS View

Remember that the VFS view is simply a server side cache of
information we know about the endpoint - it is usually out of date!

![](../../modules/gui_tour/vfs_view.png)

---


<!-- .slide: class="content small-font" -->
## Navigating the interface

* Click the “Refresh this directory” will schedule a directory listing
  artifact and wait for the results (usually very quick if the
  endpoint is online).
* The “Recursively refresh this directory” will schedule a recursive
  refresh - this may take some time! After this operation a lot of the
  VFS will be pre-populated already.
* “Collect from client” will retrieve the file data to the
  server. After which, the floppy disk sign indicates that we have
  file data available and you can click the “Download” link to get a
  copy of the file.

## The VFS interface

Previewing a file after download.

![](../../modules/gui_tour/vfs_view_2.png)

---

<!-- .slide: class="content small-font" -->

## Previewing files

The GUI allows close inpection of binary files
* Viewing in hex or text
* Paging - skipping to offset
* Searching using regex or hex strings

# Velociraptor Artifacts

## Fast, Efficient, Surgical

<img src="../../modules/artifacts_introduction/surgical.png" style="bottom: -200px" class="title-inset">

---

<!-- .slide: class="content small-font" -->

## Why a query language?
* Able to dynamically adapt to changing requirements - without needing to rebuild clients or servers.
* For example, a new IOC is released for detection of a specific threat
    * Immediately write a VQL artifact for the threat, upload the artifact and hunt everywhere for it.
    * Turn around from IOC to full hunt: A few minutes.
    * Share artifacts with the community
* VQL Artifacts are simply YAML files with VQL queries.
    * Can be easily shared and cross pollinate other Artifacts
    * Can be customized by callers.
    * [Public Artifact Reference](https://docs.velociraptor.app/artifact_references/)


---


<!-- .slide: class="content" -->

## What is VQL?

```sql
SELECT X, Y, Z FROM plugin(arg=1) WHERE X = 1
```

* `X, Y, Z` are called Column Selectors
* `plugin(arg=1)` is termed a VQL Plugin with Args
* `X = 1` is the Filter Condition


---


<!-- .slide: class="content" -->
## Velociraptor artifacts

Velociraptor is just a VQL engine!

* We package VQL queries in Artifacts:
    * YAML files
    * Include human description
    * Package related VQL queries into “Sources”
    * Take parameters for customization
    * Can in turn be used in VQL as well...

---

<!-- .slide: class="content" -->

## What does the VFS view do under the cover?

* Refreshing the VFS simply schedules new artifacts to be collected - it is just a GUI convenience.

![](../../modules/artifacts_introduction/vfs_collections.png)

---


<!-- .slide: class="content" -->
## Velociraptor uses expert knowledge to find the evidence

A key objective of Velociraptor is encapsulating DFIR knowledge into
the platform, so you don’t need to be a DFIR expert.  We have high
level questions to answer We know where to look for evidence of user /
system activities

We build artifacts to collect and analyze the evidence in order to answer our investigative questions.

---

<!-- .slide: class="full_screen_diagram" -->
## Anatomy of an artifact

![](../../modules/artifacts_introduction/artifacts.png)

---

<!-- .slide: class="content small-font" -->
## Collecting new artifacts

To collect a new artifact, from the Collected Artifacts screen,
click Collect new artifact and search for it. Select Add to add it to
this collection. When finished, click Next.

<img src="../../modules/artifacts_introduction/new-collections.png" class="mid-height">

---

<!-- .slide: class="content small-font" -->
## Configuring the artifact collection

* Many artifacts take parameters that can control the way they work.

<img src="../../modules/artifacts_introduction/configure_artifacts.png" class="mid-height">

---

<!-- .slide: class="content small-font" -->
## Configuring collection resource limits

There are many safety limits implemented into the client to control endpoint impact.

<img src="../../modules/artifacts_introduction/configure_resources.png" class="mid-height">

---

<!-- .slide: class="content small-font" -->
## What do artifacts return?

* All artifacts produce rows since they are just queries.
* Some artifacts also upload files. You can create a download zip to export all the uploaded files.

![](../../modules/artifacts_introduction/artifact-results.png)

---


<!-- .slide: class="content small-font" -->
## Uploaded files

* The uploads tab shows the file's location on the server.
* You can download or preview each one individually.

![](../../modules/artifacts_introduction/artifact-uploads.png)

---


<!-- .slide: class="content small-font" -->
## Artifact query logs

* As the query is running on the endpoint any log messages are sent to the server.
* Click the log tab to see if there were any errors and how many rows are expected.

![](../../modules/artifacts_introduction/artifact-logs.png)

---


<!-- .slide: class="content small-font" -->
## Artifacts return multiple tables (sources)
* `Source Selector`: Viewing the result tab shows the rows sent from
  every artifact and source.

![](../../modules/artifacts_introduction/artifact-sources.png)

---

<!-- .slide: class="content small-font" -->
## Exporting artifact collections

* Use the GUI to create a zip export of the collection
* Set a password in user preferences to export an encrypted Zip File

## NTFS Overview

* NTFS is the file system in all modern Windows operating systems.
* Feature packed with a design focused on storage optimization and resilience.
* NTFS implements Journalling to record metadata changes to track state and integrity of the file system.
* Allows for recovery after system crashes to avoid data loss
* File System objects referenced in a Master File Table (MFT)

---


<!-- .slide: class="content" -->
## New Technology File System

* In NTFS, the Master File Table (MFT) is at the heart of the file
  system. A structured database that stores metadata entries for every
  file and folder.
* Every object gets an entry within the MFT. Each entry is usually
  1024 bytes long.  Contains a series of attributes that fully
  describe the object.

---

<!-- .slide: class="content" -->

## MFT entries contain attributes

<div class="container small-font">
<div class="col">

## File entry examples
* $STANDARD_INFORMATION
* $FILE_NAME (Windows long name)
* $FILE_NAME (short name)
* $DATA
* $DATA  (alternate data stream sometimes)

</div>
<div class="col">

## Folder entry examples
* $STANDARD_INFORMATION
* $FILE_NAME (Windows long name)
* $FILE_NAME (short name)
* $INDEX_ROOT
* $INDEX_ALLOCATION (sometimes)

</div>

---

<!-- .slide: class="content small-font" -->

## NTFS Analysis

Velociraptor offers a number of plugins to access detailed information
about NTFS:
* `parse_mft()`: parses each MFT entry and returns high level metadata
  about the entry - including reconstruct the full path of the entry
  by traversing parent MFT entries.
* `parse_ntfs()`: Given an MFT ID this function will display
  information about the various streams (e.g. `$DATA`, `$Filename`
  etc)
* `parse_ntfs_i30()`: This scans the `$i30` stream in directories to
  recover potentially deleted entries.

---

<!-- .slide: class="content small-font" -->
## Finding suspicious files

Parse the MFT using `Windows.NTFS.MFT`

* Common DFIR use case is finding files
    * File name
    * Path
    * File type
    * Content
* Velociraptor plugins
    * glob
    * parse_mft
    * yara
    * other content based plugins

<img src="../../modules/ntfs_forensics/MFT_artifact.png" style="bottom: 0px" class="inset" />

---


<!-- .slide: class="content" -->
## Windows.Forensics. FilenameSearch

* Apply yara on the MFT
    * fast yara
    * simple string based
    * filename / top level folder only
    * comma separated
* Crude and less control
* Verbose results

<img src="../../modules/ntfs_forensics/Windows.Forensics.FilenameSearch.png" style="bottom: 0px" class="inset" />

---

<!-- .slide: class="content" -->
## Windows.NTFS.MFT

<div class="container small-font">
<div class="col">

* Parses MFT
* Easy to use
* Filters
    * Path
    * File name
    * Drive
    * Time bounds
    * Size
* Performance optimised

## Exercise - Generate test data

To automatically prep your machine run this script:
```powershell
### NTFS exercise setup

## 1. download some files to test various content and add ADS to simulate manual download from a browser

$downloads = (
    "https://live.sysinternals.com/PsExec64.exe",
    "https://live.sysinternals.com/procdump64.exe",
    "https://live.sysinternals.com/sdelete64.exe"
)

foreach ( $url in $downloads){
    "Downloading " + $Url
    $file = Split-Path $Url -Leaf
    $dest = "C:\PerfLogs\" +$file
    $ads =  "[ZoneTransfer]`r`nZoneId=3`r`nReferrerUrl=https://18.220.58.123/yolo/`r`nHostUrl=https://18.220.58.123/yolo/" + $file + "`r`n"

    Remove-Item -Path $dest -force -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
    Invoke-WebRequest -Uri $Url -OutFile $dest -UseBasicParsing
    Set-Content -Path $dest":Zone.Identifier" $ads
}
```

---


<!-- .slide: class="content" -->
## More setup

```powershell
## 2.Create a PS1 file in staging folder (any text will do but this is powershell extension)
echo "Write-Host ‘this is totally a resident file’" > C:\Perflogs\test.ps1

## 3.Modify shortname on a file
fsutil file setshortname C:\PerfLogs\psexec64.exe fake.exe

## 4. Create a process dumpOpen calculator (calc.exe)
calc.exe ; start-sleep 2
C:\PerfLogs\procdump64.exe -accepteula -ma calc C:\PerfLogs\calc.dmp
get-process | where-object { $_.Name -like "*calc*" } | Stop-Process

## 5. Create a zip file in staging folder
Compress-Archive -Path C:\PerfLogs\* -DestinationPath C:\PerfLogs\exfil.zip -CompressionLevel Fastest

## 6. Delete dmp,zip and ps1 files - deleted file discovery is important for later!
Remove-Item -Path C:\PerfLogs\*.zip, C:\PerfLogs\*.dmp, C:\PerfLogs\*.ps1
```

Note:

* Download and copy to staging folder C:\PerfLogs\
    * https://live.sysinternals.com/procdump64.exe
    * https://live.sysinternals.com/sdelete64.exe
    * https://live.sysinternals.com/psexec64.exe
* Add ADS to simulate Mark of the Web

Create a PS1 file in staging folder (any text will do but this is powershell extension)
```
echo "Write-Host ‘this is totally a resident file’" > C:\Perflogs\test.ps1
```

Modify short name on a file
```
fsutil file setshortname C:\PerfLogs\psexec64.exe fake.exe
```

Create a process dump Open calculator (`calc.exe`)
```
C:\PerfLogs\procdump64.exe -accepteula -ma calc C:\PerfLogs\calc.dmp
```

Create a zip file in staging folder - open `C:\Perflogs in Explorer`
highlight and select: Send to > Compressed (zipped) folder.
Delete `dmp.zip` and `ps1` files - deleted file discovery is important for later!
```
Remove-Item -Path C:\PerfLogs\*.zip, C:\PerfLogs\*.dmp, C:\PerfLogs\*.ps1
```


---

<!-- .slide: class="content" -->
## Exercise

<div class="container small-font">
<div class="col">

* Find contents of `C:\Perflogs`
* Review metadata of objects
* Explore leveraging filters
    * to target specific files or file types
    * to find files limited to a time frame

* Can you find the deleted files?
    * You may get lucky and have an unallocated file show.
    * Try `Windows.Forensics.Usn` with filters looking for suspicious
      extensions in our staging location!

<!-- .slide: class="content small-font" -->

## The USN journal

* Update Sequence Number Journal or Change journal is maintained by
  NTFS to record filesystem changes.
* Records metadata about filesystem changes.
* Resides in the path $Extend\$UsnJrnl:$J

![](../../modules/ntfs_forensics/usnj.png)

---

<!-- .slide: class="content" -->

## USN Journal
* Records are appended to the file at the end
* The file is sparse - periodically NTFS will remove the range at the start of the file to make it sparse
* Therefore the file will report a huge size but will actually only take about 30-40mb on disk.
* When collecting the journal file, Velociraptor will collect the sparse file.

---

<!-- .slide: class="content" -->
## Exercise - Windows.Forensics.Usn

<div class="container small-font">
<div class="col">

Target `C:\PerfLogs` with the `PathRegex` field.

* typically the USN journal only records filename and MFTId and
  ParentMFTId record. Velociraptor automatically reconstructs the
  expected path so the user can filter on path.
* This artifact uses FullPath results with “/”.

## Mounting ISO files in Windows

* Normally files downloaded from the web have the Mark Of the Web (ADS).
* This limits their ability to run macros etc.
* Files may be embedded inside an ISO file.
* ISO files may be mounted by Explorer.

---

<!-- .slide: class="content" -->
## Exercise - Atomic Red Team

Download the sample ISO file from the [Atomic Red Team](https://github.com/redcanaryco/atomic-red-team/blob/master/atomics/T1553.005/T1553.005.md#atomic-test-4---execute-lnk-file-from-iso)

* You might need to disable Windows Defender for this one!

* Double click on the ISO file to mount it.

---

<!-- .slide: class="content" -->
## Detecting the attack

We can check the event logs for mounting of the ISO.

# Offline collection

## Collecting artifacts without Velociraptor clients

---

<!-- .slide: class="content" -->
## Why Offline collection?

* I want to collect artifacts from an endpoint
* But Velociraptor is not installed on the endpoint!
* Or the endpoint is inaccessible to the Velociraptor server (no egress, firewalls etc).
* But Velociraptor is just a VQL engine!  It does not really need a server anyway

---

<!-- .slide: class="content" -->
## Create an offline collector

<div class="container">
<div class="col">

![](offline_builder.png)

</div>
<div class="col">

#### Let's select two artifacts to collect:

1. Windows.KapeFiles.Targets
    * Select the Basic Collection to get many forensic artifacts
2. Generic.Collectors.SQLECmd

</div>

---

<!-- .slide: class="full_screen_diagram" -->

### Selecting the Windows.KapeFiles.Targets artifact

![](offline_kape_targets.png)

<!-- .slide: class="full_screen_diagram" -->

### Configuring the collector to encrypt output

![](offline_configure.png)

---

<!-- .slide: class="full_screen_diagram" -->

### Downloading the prepared binary

![](offline_download_binary.png)

---

<!-- .slide: class="content" -->

## Offline collector binaries

* Preconfigured to collect the required artifacts
* No user interaction needed - just run with no command line args
* Prepare armoured Zip file with all the results in them

---

<!-- .slide: class="full_screen_diagram" -->

### Acquire data!

![](offline_acquire.png)

---

<!-- .slide: class="content" -->

## Acquired file is encrypted

* Due to limitations in the Zip format, file names can not be encrypted.
* Therefore, Velociraptor creates a second protected Zip file inside
  the outer container.
* Several encryption schemes supported:
    1. Regular password
    2. X509 - random password generated and encrypted with the server's certificate.
    3. GPG - random password generated and encrypted with the GPG public key.


---

<!-- .slide: class="content" -->

## Acquired file is encrypted

![](offline_encrypted.png)

---

<!-- .slide: class="content" -->

## Importing into Velociraptor

* Velociraptor can automatically decrypted offline containers when
  importing.
* Use the Server.Utils.ImportCollection artifact to import collections
* The server uses its private key to unlock the container automatically.
* This preserves PII and confidential information in transit!


---

<!-- .slide: class="full_screen_diagram" -->

### Import the collection into the Velociraptor server

## Detecting the attack

Using the Windows.EventLogs.Bitsadmin artifact we can check the local
event logs for signed of misuse...

# Querying the registry

## Detecting event log modifications

---


<!-- .slide: class="content" -->
## The Windows Registry

* Windows uses the registry to store configuration data.
* Many attackers modify system configuration to achieve persistence
* It is very useful to be able to query the registry!
* Velociraptor has two types of registry accessors:
    * "registry" uses the APIs
    * "raw_reg" parses the registry hives themselves


---


<!-- .slide: class="content" -->
## Example: Disable event logs

* Windows event logs are crucial for detection
* Many detection solutions rely on forwarding event logs to a backend
* It is trivial to enable/disable event log collection
* Let's look at disabling the BITS client events

## What is BITS? Why should we care?

## What is BITS?

<div class="container">
<div class="col">

BITS activity is visible in the logs

```text
bitsadmin.exe /transfer
  /download /priority
  foreground https://www.google.com
  c:\Users\test\test.ps1
```

</div>
<div class="col">

</div>

---

<!-- .slide: class="full_screen_diagram" -->
## Disable event logs

![](disable-bits-log.png)

Note:
It is easy to disable log collections - from the GUI or programmatically
Try this yourself - disable the Bits-Client logs, clear the logs and repeat the previous step

---

<!-- .slide: class="content" -->
## Query the registry for event log config

* Disabling the event logs actually results in a configuration change in the registry.
    * The relevant keys are discussed in [Disabled Event Log Files](https://docs.velociraptor.app/blog/2021/2021-01-29-disabled-event-log-files-a3529a08adbe/)
    * We can use `Windows.EventLogs.Modifications` to query log state

---

<!-- .slide: class="content" -->
## We can get a snapshot of all event logs

<!-- .slide: class="content" -->
## Being more targeted in collection

<div class="container">
<div class="col">

* Most artifacts have parameters that allow us to be more targeted in
  collection
* Being targeted is good because it reduces the amount of data we
  collect!

</div>
<div class="col">
<img src="bits-targeted-collection.png" class="title-inset">
</div>
</div>

---

<!-- .slide: class="content" -->
## More targeted in collection
* Treat the endpoint as the ultimate source of truth - need more
  data? go back and re-fetch it from the endpoint.

![](Windows.EventLogs.Modifications.png)

---

<!-- .slide: class="content small-font" -->
## Post processing with notebooks

* Another alternative is to collect all the data and then post-process using the GUI
    * Helps us drill into the data and understand what is going on.

# Hunting at scale

---

<!-- .slide: class="content" -->
## Hunting - mass collections

Hunting is Velociraptor's strength - collect the same artifact from thousands of endpoints in minutes!

* Two types of hunts:
   * Detection hunts are very targeted aimed at yes/no answer
   * Collection hunts collect a lot more data and can be used to
     build a baseline.

---

<!-- .slide: class="content" -->
## Exercise - baseline event logs

For this exercise we start a few more clients.

```text
c:\Users\test>cd c:\Users\test\AppData\Local\Temp\

c:\Users\test\AppData\Local\Temp>Velociraptor.exe
   --config client.config.yaml pool_client --number 100
```

This starts 100 virtual clients so we can hunt them
* We use pool clients to simulate load on the server

---


<!-- .slide: class="full_screen_diagram" -->
## Pool clients
Simply multiple instances of the same client

## Create a hunt

<!-- .slide: class="full_screen_diagram" -->
## Select hunt artifacts

<!-- .slide: class="full_screen_diagram" -->
## Collect results

![](create-hunt.png)

---


<!-- .slide: class="content" -->
## Exercise - Stacking

* The previous collection may be considered the baseline
* For this exercise we want to create a few different clients.
    * Stop the pool client
    * Disable a log channel
    * Start the pool client with an additional number of clients

```
Velociraptor.exe --config client.config.yaml pool_client --number 110
```

---


<!-- .slide: class="full_screen_diagram" -->
## Stacking can reveal results that stand out

## What did we not cover?

* Velociraptor has a lot more than we were able to cover here:
* Many more sources of data: Event logs, ETW, WMI eventing
* Multi-Platform: Linux, MacOS, Windows, FreeBSD
* Endpoint monitoring in real time: Detect and identify compromises in real time!
* Automatic remediation: Apply active remediation to remove the driver and ensure all endpoints are clean.
* Server automation and monitoring in real time with a python API.

<!-- .slide: class="content" -->
## Conclusions

* In this workshop we introduced Velociraptor - a powerful endpoint
  visibility solution, as used in a typical DFIR exercise.

* We introduced VQL and gave some examples…
    * Searching for files,
    * registry keys and other endpoint state Hunting everywhere

## Conclusions

We only scratched the surface of what Velociraptor can do!
