       ## Compliance and certifications
       
       * 20 Years ago was the wild west!
          * Outsourcing was all the rage!
       
       * Today we have extensive frameworks:
          * [GDPR](https://gdpr.eu/) - enforces privacy guards with penalties!!!
          * [PCI](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/) - Required for CC data!
          * [HIPAA](https://www.cdc.gov/phlp/php/resources/health-insurance-portability-and-accountability-act-of-1996-hipaa.html) - Required for managing health data
          * [IRAP](https://www.cyber.gov.au/irap) - Certification for Aus Gov
       * Many professional auditors and consultants to enforce compliance.
          * Is it perfect? No...

       ## Security auditing of application code.
       
       * Back in early 2000's:
          * Everyone was speeding to deploy a web presence
          * Security was an afterthought in many cases
          * Low skill of developers
          * Languages were not robust enough - too easy to do the wrong thing.
       
       * Really fun to break applications!

       ## Software vulnerabilities
       
       Common vulnerabilities include [SQL Injection](https://pentest-tools.com/blog/sql-injection-attacks)
       *  This vulnerability leads to complete server take over

       ## Impact of software vulnerability
       ### In early 2000s
       
       * When a security vulnerability was exploited:
          * It was usually a teenager or student just playing around
          * Often they tried to embarrass the agency or government department
          * Media jumped on the "incompetence of government"
       
       * Generally not a huge impact
          * backup, restore, rebuild!

       ## Law enforcement
       
       * The field of Digital Forensics was just getting started in early
         2000's
       * Today most cases involve an element of Digital Forensics:
           * Computers
           * Phones
           * Cars
           * Watches and health data
           * Surveillance
           * Game consoles

       ## A hacking case...
       
       * A complex case consisting of
         * Manual investigation of multiple server drives.
           * Compromises over a couple of years
       
         * Images shipped from multiple countries.
       
       * Arrest made of 22yo University Student
       * Outcome was no conviction recorded
         * let off with a warning: motive was curiosity and desire to learn computer security.
       
       * Really good exercise for all involved!
         * Best practice evidence collection, chain of custody etc!

       ## Law Enforcement challenges
       
       * Modern criminals are highly aware of information security!
       * Software has gotten a lot more secure
       * Sometimes new and innovative solutions are required
       * Legislation to provide access is sometimes at odds with privacy
           * End to End Encryption vs Law enforcement access
           * US [Fifth amendment](https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/amendment-5/) vs Australia's [Section 3LA](https://www5.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ca191482/s3la.html)

       ## Incident Response - Blue team
       
       * When a security breach occurs - Time is of the essence!
       
       * Attacks typically follow the [Cyber Kill Chain](https://www.lockheedmartin.com/en-us/capabilities/cyber/cyber-kill-chain.html):
          * Installation or compromise
          * Command and Control (C2)
          * Actions on objectives - i.e. Data exfiltration or encryption.
       
       * Dwell time is the time between initial compromise and objective.

       ## Software development
       ### Security industry
       
       * All software developers must have a strong grounding in information
         security!
       
       * Developing security specific software needs a working knowledge of:
           * Detection Engineering
           * Low level OS internals - gather telemetry
           * High performance computing - scaling up!
           * Large Data analytics
