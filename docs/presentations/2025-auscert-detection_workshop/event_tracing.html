## Event Tracing for Windows (ETW)

<div class="container small-font">
<div class="col">

* Framework Built into windows
* Matches Consumers to Providers
* Forms the basis of the windows event logs
* Traces can be either written to file or read directly by consumers.

<!-- .slide: class="content small-font" -->
## How does ETW work ?

* Various software packages throughout the Operating System register themselves as an Event Provider using a unique GUID
* As the software operates, various logging points within the code send "Events" to the provider.
* The operating system simply matches consumers with providers
* A consumer registers interest in a particular provider using the GUID
* Note that if no consumers are interested ETW logging points are essentially free.

---

<!-- .slide: class="content small-font" -->
## ETW Providers

* Any software can define an ETW provider
* There is no consistency - some providers are detailed - some not
* Discoverability is an issue! Some providers are less documented
* It is sometimes possible to infer a lot of providers from their manifest files.
* There are some public efforts to better document the available providers.

## The Windows Base ETW Model

---

<!-- .slide: class="content" -->

## The Windows Base ETW Model

* Enriches events with process information
   * Uses the process tracker

* Velociraptor does special post processing for many critical
  providers.

* The Velociraptor Sigma Project site gives samples of events to help
  users write rules that target those events.

---

<!-- .slide: class="content small-font" -->

## Developing Sigma Rules with the ETW Model

* The ETW Sigma Model relies on live events
* This makes it difficult to develop Sigma Rules for it
   * We need to simulate an attack on a real system
   * Then we need to formulate a Sigma Rule
   * Replay the attack and iterate
* It is sometimes difficult to simulate the attack
   * The target system needs to be prepared exactly for the simulated
     attack to work.
   * It is not always easy to capture the raw events upon which the
     Sigma rules apply.

## The Sigma Rule Development workflow.
### Break the development cycle into two parts

## Exercise: Capture ETW events for PsExec Attack

* The Windows ETW model includes a `CaptureTest` artifact.
   * Use it in a notebook to capture events during the attack

```sql
SELECT *
FROM Artifact.Windows.Sigma.ETWBase.CaptureTestSet(LogSourceFilter="etw/windows/file")
WHERE EventData =~ "psexesvc"
```

* Now performs the PsExec attack again
```
psexec.exe /s cmd.exe
```

## Sigma Rule development methodology

* By splitting attack simulation from detection

    * We can emulate attack on any required platform
       * Collecting the test set can be done remotely!

    * Develop Sigma Rules on any other platform
       * Where we have Velociraptor server

    * Develop rules quickly and iteratively against the recorded set.

---

<!-- .slide: class="content" -->

## Testing detections

* One of the most important functions of Detection Engineering

* Ensure no regressions! Two possibilities:
   1. Sensors stop forwarding particular event types
   2. Rules are not applied on events

* Automated tests can be developed
   * On platform ensure that correct event types are generated
   * Continuous integration tests ensure rules are applied to recorded events.

## Recap: Event Tracing For Windows

* Real time events can be read from various software components
* Introspecting low level software functionality
* Can write more powerful detections
* In the next section we will see how to enrich these events with Forensics!
