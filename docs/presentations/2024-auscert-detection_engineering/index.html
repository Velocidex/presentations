## Advances in Detection Engineering

### Mike Cohen, Digital Paleontologist, Rapid7

<!-- .slide: class="content" -->

## What is Detection Engineering?

* The science and art of writing, maintaining and testing detection rules to
  maximize detection chances in response to an evolving detection
  landscape.

* Not a new thing!

* Important to recognize it as a separate skillset.

* This talk discusses some of the challenges in testing and
  maintaining detection rules, specifically Sigma rules.

## Traditional SIEM based detection

---

<!-- .slide: class="content small-font" -->

## Traditional SIEM based detection

1. Parses certain raw event logs on the endpoint
2. Applies normalization of fields
3. Forwards events to SIEM
4. Queries are run on SIEM using a specialized query language to
   detect anomalies.

* But we have many different types of SIEM and incompatible schemas,
  query languages and type of data collected

* Difficult to port rules between detection stacks!

---

<!-- .slide: class="content small-font" -->

## How can we improve this

"We can solve any problem by introducing an extra level of indirection." (David Wheeler)


Let's just define a new "Standard":
* That everyone understands...
* Can be converted to all other EDR systems
* Can facilitate detection interchange

---

<!-- .slide: class="full_screen_diagram" -->

## New interchange format - Sigma

<img src="sigma_architecture.png" style=" height: 60vh;"/>

---

<!-- .slide: class="content small-font" -->

## Example

```yaml
logsource:
    category: process_creation
    product: windows
detection:
    process_creation:
        EventID: 4688
        Channel: Security
    selection:
        -   CommandLine|contains|all:
                - \AppData\Roaming\Oracle
                - \java
                - '.exe '
        -   CommandLine|contains|all:
                - cscript.exe
                - Retrive
                - '.vbs '
    condition: process_creation and selection

```

---

<!-- .slide: class="content small-font" -->

## Anatomy of a Sigma rule

* To compile a Sigma Rule into a SIEM query we need:

1. A compiler able to generate SIEM Query Language output
2. Log Sources -> Map from generic log source to concrete data collected by SIEM
3. Field Mappings -> Map from generic field names to SIEM schema transformation.

---

<!-- .slide: class="content small-font" -->

## Let's consider how a Sigma Compiler might work

* Logsource: What does `process_creation` mean exactly?
    * Could be Sysmon EID 1
    * System EID 4688
    * ... Or maybe something else?

* What fields do we need?
    * CommandLine - Do we even collect this?

* Actually this rule can only ever work on `Security.evtx`!
    * The Rule author ensures this because they specifically test for
      the right EID and Channel within the rule logic.
    * The log source is kind of redundant

---


<!-- .slide: class="content small-font" -->

## Using Sigma rules effectively

* Many Sigma rules will result in many false positives.
* Need to be tailored for the environment - is this suspicious?
* Can it be trivially bypassed?

```yaml
title: PSExec Lateral Movement
logsource:
    product: windows
    service: system
detection:
    selection:
        Channel: System
        EventID: 7045
    selection_PSEXESVC_in_service:
        Service: PSEXESVC
    selection_PSEXESVC_in_path:
        ImagePath|contains: PSEXESVC
    condition: selection and (selection_PSEXESVC_in_service or selection_PSEXESVC_in_path)
```

---

<!-- .slide: class="content small-font" -->

## Using more information to assist...

* Some log sources contain more information

```yaml
title: Potential Defense Evasion Via Rename Of Highly Relevant Binaries
author: Matthew Green - @mgreen27, Florian Roth (Nextron Systems), frack113
logsource:
    category: process_creation
    product: windows
detection:
    selection:
      - Description: 'Execute processes remotely'
      - Product: 'Sysinternals PsExec'
      - OriginalFileName:
          - 'psexec.exe'
```

---

<!-- .slide: class="content small-font" -->

## Example: Hash based rules

* Loading of known Vulnerable driver might indicate exploitation

```yaml
title: Vulnerable Lenovo Driver Load
author: Florian Roth (Nextron Systems)
logsource:
    category: driver_load
        product: windows
detection:
    selection_sysmon:
        Hashes|contains:
        - 'SHA256=F05B1EE9E2F6AB704B8919D5071BECBCE6F9D0F9D0BA32A460C41D5272134ABE'
        - 'SHA1=B89A8EEF5AEAE806AF5BA212A8068845CAFDAB6F'
        - 'MD5=B941C8364308990EE4CC6EADF7214E0F'
    selection_hash:
        - sha256: 'f05b1ee9e2f6ab704b8919d5071becbce6f9d0f9d0ba32a460c41d5272134abe'
        - sha1: 'b89a8eef5aeae806af5ba212a8068845cafdab6f'
        - md5: 'b941c8364308990ee4cc6eadf7214e0f'
    condition: 1 of selection*
```

---

<!-- .slide: class="content" -->

## Can we bypass this?

* Modifying the executable will change the hash
* But the driver is signed - the kernel requires valid signature to load.
* Surely we can not change the driver without invalidating the signature?

Actually... Yes

* Authenticode signatures do not cover the whole file!

---

<!-- .slide: class="content small-font" -->

## ImpHash is a better hash to use

```yaml
title: Vulnerable HackSys Extreme Vulnerable Driver Load
author: Nasreddine Bencherchali (Nextron Systems)
logsource:
    product: windows
    category: driver_load
detection:
    selection_name:
        ImageLoaded|endswith: '\HEVD.sys'
    selection_sysmon:
        Hashes|contains:
        - 'IMPHASH=f26d0b110873a1c7d8c4f08fbeab89c5' # Version 3.0
        - 'IMPHASH=c46ea2e651fd5f7f716c8867c6d13594' # Version 3.0
    selection_other:
        Imphash:
        - 'f26d0b110873a1c7d8c4f08fbeab89c5' # Version 3.0
        - 'c46ea2e651fd5f7f716c8867c6d13594' # Version 3.0
    condition: 1 of selection*
```

---

<!-- .slide: class="content" -->

## Sigma shortcomings

### How do we know if a rule even makes sense?

* Rule do not refer directly to the fields in the event
* Instead they refer to an "abstract" field name
* The compiler maps the abstract field name to the SIEM schema
    * Assuming there is such a mapping
    * Assuming that field is actually available in the SIEM

---

<!-- .slide: class="content small-font" -->

## Example 2: Invalid Field Mapping

* Some rules refer to non-existant fields.

```yaml
title: Remote Thread Creation By Uncommon Source Image
logsource:
    product: windows
    category: create_remote_thread
detection:
    create_remote_thread:
        EventID: 8
        Channel: Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational
    selection:
        SourceImage|endswith:
            - \bash.exe
            - \cscript.exe
            ...
            - \wmic.exe
            - \wscript.exe
    filter_main_winlogon_1:
        SourceImage: C:\Windows\System32\winlogon.exe
        TargetImage:
            - C:\Windows\System32\services.exe
            - C:\Windows\System32\wininit.exe
            - C:\Windows\System32\csrss.exe
    filter_main_winlogon_2:
        SourceImage: C:\Windows\System32\winlogon.exe
        TargetParentImage: System
        TargetParentProcessId: 4
        ...
    condition: create_remote_thread and (selection and not 1 of filter_main_* and
        not 1 of filter_optional_*)
```

---

<!-- .slide: class="content small-font" -->

## Some fields only exist sometimes

* The `CommandLine` field for Event ID 4688 is only populated with
  correct group policy settings.

```yaml
logsource:
    category: process_creation
    product: windows
detection:
    process_creation:
        EventID: 4688
        Channel: Security
    selection:
        -   CommandLine|contains|all:
                - \AppData\Roaming\Oracle
                - \java
                - '.exe '
        -   CommandLine|contains|all:
                - cscript.exe
                - Retrive
                - '.vbs '
    condition: process_creation and selection
```

---

<!-- .slide: class="content small-font" -->

## Log Source section

* Many Sigma rules have ambiguous log sources.
* The Hayabusa project adds Channel matches to refer to a specific
  event log.

```yaml
logsource:
    category: process_creation
    product: windows
detection:
    process_creation:
        EventID: 4688
        Channel: Security
    selection:
        -   CommandLine|contains|all:
                - \AppData\Roaming\Oracle
                - \java
...
```

## Triaging Using Sigma

* Endpoint tools can directly evaluate Sigma rules on the event logs

## Extending the capabilities of Sigma rules

* Evaluating the Sigma rules on the endpoint is more powerful:
    * We have access to all log sources
    * We have access to the raw/un-normalized data
    * We only ship hits to the server

* Why stop with that?
    * We have access to much more on the endpoint!
    * Registry/Files/Forensic Artifacts

---

<!-- .slide: class="content small-font" -->

## Extending the capabilities of Sigma rules

* Logsource of type `VQL` evaluates arbitrary VQL expressions.
* Sigma modifier `vql` allows arbitrary VQL conditions

```yaml
title: Rclone
logsource:
    category: vql
    product: windows

detection:
    selection:
      "EventData|vql":
          x=>x.Files OR x.Registry

    condition: selection

vql: |
  x=>dict(EventData=dict(
    Files={
      SELECT OSPath, Size, read_file(filename=OSPath, length=100) AS Data
      FROM glob(globs=Path, accessor="auto")
    },
    Registry=to_dict(item={
      SELECT Name AS _key, Data.value AS _value
      FROM glob(globs=Key, accessor="registry")
    })))

vql_args:
    Path: C:\Users\*\AppData\Roaming\rclone\rclone.conf
    Key: HKEY_USERS\*\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\AppCompatFlags\Compatibility Assistant\Store\*rclone*
```

<!-- .slide: class="content" -->

## Detection vs. Forensics

* VQL Sigma rules bridge detection with forensics.
* Forensics: `What happened here?`
    * Recover all the information - relevant or not
    * Get a full picture.

* Detection: `What bad things happened here?`
    * Take the forensic information and rapidly zero in on obvious bad
      signals.
    * Not designed to be exhaustive! Triage oriented

* Complimentary capabilities

---

<!-- .slide: class="content" -->

## Real Time Sigma alerting

* VQL is fully asynchronous - real time queries.

<!-- .slide: class="content" -->

## Conclusions

* Detection Engineering is an important role, requiring a lot of
  experience and dedication.

* Open detection standards like Sigma are helpful for sharing
  detections across platforms.

* The industry is moving from centralized data mining of forwarded
  event logs to on host detection.
    * Takes experience and manual review to get the most out of Sigma

---

<!-- .slide: class="content" -->

## Conclusions

* Detection based triage can help focus the investigation
    * scale  out to thousands of hosts

* On endpoint detection can use a lot more than event logs!
    * Extending capabilities to traditional Digital Forensics

* Sigma rules can be applied live on the endpoint
    * Rather than forward all events - more focused high value events.
