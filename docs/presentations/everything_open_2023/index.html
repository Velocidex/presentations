## Overview

This workshop introduces Velociraptor - an advanced endpoint
visibility tool for DFIR.

* We focus on Linux systems
* Two main scenarios:

  1. SSH key compromise leading to lateral movement and privilege escalation.
  2. Webshell detection.

---

<!-- .slide: class="content" -->
## Requirements

This workshop will use Linux!
You should run on a Linux VM or system.

## What is Velociraptor?
* Velociraptor is a unique Free and Open Source DFIR tool, giving you
  power and flexibility through the Velociraptor Query Language
* VQL is used to drive a powerful set of forensic capabilities:
* Using VQL we can write custom "Artifacts" to identify emerging threats quickly and safely
* Hunt for artifacts at scale over thousands of end points within
  minutes!

<!-- .slide: class="full_screen_diagram" -->
## Deployment overview
![](../../modules/overview/deployment_overview.svg)

---


<!-- .slide: class="content" -->
## Typical deployments

* Support Linux, Windows, MacOS, FreeBSD …
* Server simply collects the results of queries - clients do all the heavy lifting.
* Client memory and CPU usage is controlled via throttling and active cancellations.
* Server is optimized for speed and scalability
* Concurrency control ensures stability
* Bandwidth limits ensure network stability

---


<!-- .slide: class="content" -->
## Typical deployments

Current recommendations
* 10k-15k clients - single server with file based data store (usually cloud VM).
* SSL load is the biggest load - TLS offloading helps a lot!
* 8 GB RAM/8 cores is generous towards the top of the range.
* We recommend Ubuntu/Debian server
    * 15-20k to 150k endpoints we recommend a multi-frontend setup.

# Velociraptor Installation and GUI tour

---


<!-- .slide: class="content" -->
## Create a local server

* Create a local server on your windows system.
* We will use this server's notebook feature to learn about windows artifacts
* Run Velociraptor on your machine
    * Download Velociraptor from GitHub (.msi or .exe)

```
velociraptor-v0.6.6-2-windows-amd64.exe gui
```

---


<!-- .slide: class="full_screen_diagram" -->

The "gui" command creates an instant temporary server/client with self
  signed SSL and a hard coded admin/password.

![](../../modules/gui_tour/velociraptor-gui.png)

<!-- .slide: class="full_screen_diagram" -->
## Your Velociraptor is ready to use!

# A Velociraptor GUI tour

<img src="../../modules/gui_tour/tour-bus.png" class="title-inset">

---

<!-- .slide: class="content" -->

## The Dashboard

* The Dashboard shows the current state of the installation:
    * How many clients are connected
    * Current CPU load and memory footprint on the server.
    * When running hunts or intensive processing, memory and CPU requirements will increase but not too much.
    * You can customize the dashboard - it’s also just an artifact.

---

<!-- .slide: class="full_screen_diagram" -->

## The Dashboard

## User Preferences

You can customize the interface to your liking


<div class="container small-font">

# Interactively investigate individual clients

---


<!-- .slide: class="content small-font" -->
## Searching for a client

To work with a specific client we need to search for it.  Press the
**Search** or **Show All** button to see some clients. You can also
use the **Show recent hosts** to see your own clients.

![](../../modules/gui_tour/search_clients.png)

---

<!-- .slide: class="content" -->
## Search for clients

### hostname, label, or client ID.

* You can start typing the hostname to auto-complete
* Some common terms:
   * `host`: search by hostnames
   * `mac`: Mac addresses
   * `ip`: last seen IP address
   * `label`: Search by labels

---


<!-- .slide: class="content small-font" -->
## Client Overview

* Internally the client id is considered the most accurate source of
endpoint identity

![](../../modules/gui_tour/client_overview.png)

---

<!-- .slide: class="content small-font" -->
## Shell commands

* Velociraptor allows running shell commands on the endpoint using
  `Powershell`/`Cmd`/`Bash`
    * Only Velociraptor users with the administrator role are allowed to
  do this!
    * Actions are logged and audited

```powershell
Get-LocalGroupMember -Group "Administrators"
```

<!-- .slide: class="title" -->
# Interactively fetching files from the endpoint

<img src="../../modules/gui_tour/fetch.png" class="title-inset">

---

<!-- .slide: class="content small-font" -->
## The VFS View

Remember that the VFS view is simply a server side cache of
information we know about the endpoint - it is usually out of date!

![](../../modules/gui_tour/vfs_view.png)

---


<!-- .slide: class="content small-font" -->
## Navigating the interface

* Click the “Refresh this directory” will schedule a directory listing
  artifact and wait for the results (usually very quick if the
  endpoint is online).
* The “Recursively refresh this directory” will schedule a recursive
  refresh - this may take some time! After this operation a lot of the
  VFS will be pre-populated already.
* “Collect from client” will retrieve the file data to the
  server. After which, the floppy disk sign indicates that we have
  file data available and you can click the “Download” link to get a
  copy of the file.

# Velociraptor Artifacts

## Fast, Efficient, Surgical

<img src="../../modules/artifacts_introduction/surgical.png" style="bottom: -200px" class="title-inset">

---

<!-- .slide: class="content small-font" -->

## Why a query language?
* Able to dynamically adapt to changing requirements - without needing to rebuild clients or servers.
* For example, a new IOC is released for detection of a specific threat
    * Immediately write a VQL artifact for the threat, upload the artifact and hunt everywhere for it.
    * Turn around from IOC to full hunt: A few minutes.
    * Share artifacts with the community
* VQL Artifacts are simply YAML files with VQL queries.
    * Can be easily shared and cross pollinate other Artifacts
    * Can be customized by callers.
    * [Public Artifact Reference](https://docs.velociraptor.app/artifact_references/)


---


<!-- .slide: class="content" -->

## What is VQL?

```sql
SELECT X, Y, Z FROM plugin(arg=1) WHERE X = 1
```

* `X, Y, Z` are called Column Selectors
* `plugin(arg=1)` is termed a VQL Plugin with Args
* `X = 1` is the Filter Condition


---


<!-- .slide: class="content" -->
## Velociraptor artifacts

Velociraptor is just a VQL engine!

* We package VQL queries in Artifacts:
    * YAML files
    * Include human description
    * Package related VQL queries into “Sources”
    * Take parameters for customization
    * Can in turn be used in VQL as well...

---

<!-- .slide: class="content" -->

## What does the VFS view do under the cover?

* Refreshing the VFS simply schedules new artifacts to be collected - it is just a GUI convenience.

![](../../modules/artifacts_introduction/vfs_collections.png)

---


<!-- .slide: class="content" -->
## Velociraptor uses expert knowledge to find the evidence

A key objective of Velociraptor is encapsulating DFIR knowledge into
the platform, so you don’t need to be a DFIR expert.  We have high
level questions to answer We know where to look for evidence of user /
system activities

We build artifacts to collect and analyze the evidence in order to answer our investigative questions.

---

<!-- .slide: class="full_screen_diagram" -->
## Anatomy of an artifact

![](../../modules/artifacts_introduction/artifacts.png)

---

<!-- .slide: class="content small-font" -->
## Collecting new artifacts

To collect a new artifact, from the Collected Artifacts screen,
click Collect new artifact and search for it. Select Add to add it to
this collection. When finished, click Next.

<img src="../../modules/artifacts_introduction/new-collections.png" class="mid-height">

---

<!-- .slide: class="content small-font" -->
## Configuring the artifact collection

* Many artifacts take parameters that can control the way they work.

<img src="../../modules/artifacts_introduction/configure_artifacts.png" class="mid-height">

---

<!-- .slide: class="content small-font" -->
## Configuring collection resource limits

There are many safety limits implemented into the client to control endpoint impact.

<img src="../../modules/artifacts_introduction/configure_resources.png" class="mid-height">

---

<!-- .slide: class="content small-font" -->
## What do artifacts return?

* All artifacts produce rows since they are just queries.
* Some artifacts also upload files. You can create a download zip to export all the uploaded files.

![](../../modules/artifacts_introduction/artifact-results.png)

---


<!-- .slide: class="content small-font" -->
## Uploaded files

* The uploads tab shows the file's location on the server.
* You can download or preview each one individually.

![](../../modules/artifacts_introduction/artifact-uploads.png)

---


<!-- .slide: class="content small-font" -->
## Artifact query logs

* As the query is running on the endpoint any log messages are sent to the server.
* Click the log tab to see if there were any errors and how many rows are expected.

![](../../modules/artifacts_introduction/artifact-logs.png)

---


<!-- .slide: class="content small-font" -->
## Artifacts return multiple tables (sources)
* `Source Selector`: Viewing the result tab shows the rows sent from
  every artifact and source.

![](../../modules/artifacts_introduction/artifact-sources.png)

---

<!-- .slide: class="content small-font" -->
## Exporting artifact collections

* Use the GUI to create a zip export of the collection
* Set a password in user preferences to export an encrypted Zip File

## Secure Shell
###  Linux remote access

![](../../modules/secure_shell/openssh_logo.png)

---

<!-- .slide: class="content" -->
## Secure Shell
###  Linux remote access

On Unix like systems, remote administration is usually done using
Secure Shell (SSH)
* Authentication is usually decentralized:
  * Username/Password based
  * Public/Private key based

---

<!-- .slide: class="content" -->
## Secure Shell
###  Linux remote access

* Authorization is usually achieved in a decentralized way
  * `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` file lists all keys allowed to log in to this machine.
  * `~/.ssh/known_hosts` file list all hosts known to this user (that the user has logged into previously).

---

<!-- .slide: class="content" -->
## Typical SSH based attacks

1. A user account with password auth is compromized on an endpoint.
2. This gives the attacker a foothold on that host.
3. Unsecured ssh keys can be used on that host to log into other hosts
4. When the attacker logs into the other hosts they may change their user account

---

<!-- .slide: class="content" -->
## Typical SSH escalation path

![](../../modules/secure_shell/ssh_attack_outline.png)

---

<!-- .slide: class="content" -->
## Investigative steps
### Search for password login

Search the SSH logs for successful login using a password. This should
   not be common in practice!

![](../../modules/secure_shell/finding_ssh_logs.png)

---

<!-- .slide: class="content" -->
## Investigative steps
### Find successful password logins

![](../../modules/secure_shell/password_authenticated.png)

---

<!-- .slide: class="content" -->
## Investigative steps
### Did any of our hosts have unsecured keys?

![](../../modules/secure_shell/unsecured_ssh_keys.png)

---

<!-- .slide: class="content" -->
## Investigative steps
### Which machines trust the unsecured key?

SSH uses the `authorized_keys` file to grant access to trusted keys.

To find all machines that might grant access to this key we need to check that file everywhere.

This is called a `Hunt`

---

<!-- .slide: class="content" -->
## Investigative steps
### Did the key actually get used?

We can determine if any machine account was used to log into another
host using the `known_hosts` file.

This file records the hostname and host public key that were used in the past

If we find the vulneable machine was logged into this might mean the
vulnerable key was used.

Unfortunately the hostname is hashed!!!

<!-- .slide: class="content" -->
## Web shell
### A hacker's favorite backdoor

A webshell is a way for an attacker to obtain a shell over the web
* Sometimes this is done by adding malicious active content (PHP,ASP,CGI)
* Often it is installed as an additional service that looks like a web service
* Can contain authentication and/or encryption.

---

<!-- .slide: class="content" -->
## Web shell
### Exercise

In this exercise we start an opensource web shell, typical of
malicious web shells.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/JiangKlijna/web-shell
$ cd web-shell
$ make
$ ./web-shell -s -P 2020 -u admin -p admin -cmd bash
```

This creates the server web shell. (Alternatively download the Github
release)

---

<!-- .slide: class="content" -->
## Web shell
### The client

Connect to the local webshell server using the client over HTTP (with
the above username and password for authentication.

```
$ ./web-shell -c -H localhost -P 2020 -u admin -p admin
$ ping www.google.com
PING www.google.com (172.217.24.36) 56(84) bytes of data.
64 bytes from hkg07s23-in-f4.1e100.net (172.217.24.36): icmp_seq=1 ttl=114 time=27.9 ms
64 bytes from hkg07s23-in-f36.1e100.net (172.217.24.36): icmp_seq=2 ttl=114 time=27.7 ms
```

---

<!-- .slide: class="content" -->
## Detection
### Detecting the web shell via network

How would we detect this webshell?

* Search for listening ports and enrich

Use the `Linux.Network.NetstatEnriched` artifact to look for listening
ports.

---

<!-- .slide: class="content" -->

### Process Tree

![](/process_tree.png)

---

<!-- .slide: class="content" -->
## Detection
### Looking in memory

Some attack tools do not have files on disk
1. File may be packed/encrypted
2. On Linux the file may be deleted (but process is running)
3. Malicious code may be injected into another process

Scan in memory!  *Yara scan*

## Custom Detection
### Developing custom detection artifacts

<img src="detection.jpg" style="height: 400px" >

---

<!-- .slide: class="content" -->
## What are we looking for?

Ultimately a Web Shell is:

1. A shell process (e.g. Bash or Powershell)
2. Spawned from another process along the call chain
3. One of the processes along the call chain is listening for network
   connections.

Examples:
```
    systemd -> screen -> bash -> mc -> bash -> web-shell -> bash
    systemd -> sshd -> sshd -> bash
```

---

<!-- .slide: class="content" -->
## Writing custom artifacts
### Developing in VQL

```sql
-- Get all listening Pids and store in a lookup structure
LET ListeningPids <= memoize(
key="Pid",
query={
    SELECT Laddr.ip AS IP,
         Laddr.port AS Port,
         str(str=Pid) AS Pid
  FROM connections()
  WHERE Status =~ "LISTEN"
   AND Pid != "0"
})

-- A Function to determine if any pid in the Pids list is listening
LET IsPidListening(Pids) = SELECT _value FROM foreach(row=Pids)
  WHERE get(item=ListeningPids, field=str(str=_value))

-- Get all bash processes and their callchain
LET CallChains = SELECT Pid,
  Name,
  CommandLine,
  join(array=process_tracker_callchain(id=Pid).Data.Name, sep=" -> ") AS CallChain,
  process_tracker_callchain(id=Pid).Data.Pid AS CallChainPids
FROM process_tracker_pslist()
WHERE Name =~ "bash"

-- A Suspicious shell is one that is spawned from
-- any process which also has a listening port.
SELECT Pid, Name, CommandLine, CallChain,
  {
    SELECT process_tracker_get(id=_value).Data AS Details
    FROM IsPidListening(Pids=CallChainPids)
    LIMIT 1
  } AS ListeningProcess
FROM CallChains
WHERE ListeningProcess

---

<!-- .slide: class="content" -->
## Hunting
### Collecting artifacts from many hosts

Hunting is Velociraptor's strength - collect the same artifact from
thousands of endpoints in minutes!

* Two types of hunts:
   * Detection hunts are very targeted aimed at yes/no answer
   * Collection hunts collect a lot more data and can be used to
     build a baseline.

---

<!-- .slide: class="content" -->
## Exercise
### Baseline pam configuration

For this exercise we start a few more clients. Velociraptor's pool
client can simulate multiple clients easily.

```text
$ cd /tmp/
$ velociraptor --config client.config.yaml pool_client --number 100
```

This starts 100 virtual clients so we can hunt them

---

<!-- .slide: class="content" -->
## Exercise
### Stacking hunt results.

For this exercise, we simulate 100 clean machines, and 1 compromised
machine.

1. Stop the webshell server
2. Start 100 pool clients
3. Create a hunt for `Exchange.Linux.System.PAM`

---

<!-- .slide: class="content" -->
## Exercise
### Hunting

![](hunting.png)

---

<!-- .slide: class="content" -->
## Exercise
### Stacking hunt results.

When the hunt completes:

4. Stop the pool client
5. Add the following line to `/etc/pam/su-l`

```
auth sufficient pam_succeed_if.so uid >= 0
```

6. Start the pool client again with 101 clients.
  * This causes the new client to join the hunt and detect the webshell.

---

<!-- .slide: class="content" -->
## Identifying anomalies.

* Anomalies are things that are not usual compared to the rest of the
  network.
* One tool for detecting anomalies is called `Stacking` - in VQL done
  using the `GROUP BY` keyword.
* Stacking is useful when looking at something that should be common
  across most systems (e.g. OS configuration)

---

<!-- .slide: class="content" -->

## What did we not cover?

* Velociraptor has a lot more than we were able to cover here:
* Many more sources of data: Event logs, ETW, WMI eventing
* Multi-Platform: Linux, MacOS, Windows, FreeBSD
* Endpoint monitoring in real time: Detect and identify compromises in real time!
* Automatic remediation: Apply active remediation to remove the driver and ensure all endpoints are clean.
* Server automation and monitoring in real time with a python API.

---

<!-- .slide: class="content" -->
## Conclusions

* In this workshop we introduced Velociraptor - a powerful endpoint
  visibility solution, as used in a typical DFIR exercise.

* We introduced VQL and gave some examples…
    * Searching for files,
    * registry keys and other endpoint state Hunting everywhere
