<!-- .slide: class="content" -->

## A hacking case...

* A complex case consisting of
  * Manual investigation of multiple server drives.
    * Compromises over a couple of years

  * Images shipped from multiple countries.

* Arrest made of 22yo University Student
* Outcome was no conviction recorded
  * let off with a warning: motive was curiosity and desire to learn computer security.

* Really good exercise for all involved!
  * Best practice evidence collection, chain of custody etc!

## How do you execute 400 search warrants simultaneously?

* A large scale coordinated operation poses a lot of challenges!
   * We don't have hundreds of DF experts! üëÆ
   * We can not take images of absolutely everything (Even in 2004!)
   * We can not seize every device. üñ•Ô∏è üíªüìµ
   * 72 hours to determine relevance!
   * Need to have chain of custody and follow correct procedures!

---

<!-- .slide: class="content" -->

## How do you execute 400 search warrants simultaneously?

* Solution: Triage!

* Created a custom bootable CD üìÄ
  * Knoppix!
  * Carve images from disk!
  * Present them in a page of thumbnails!

* Distribute CD in advance
* Use every available resource to triage!
  * No specialist DF skill required üßë‚Äçüíª
  * It is usually pretty obvious when a system requires proper
    escalation to DF experts üò±

---

<!-- .slide: class="content" -->

## Key takeaways...

* Digital Forensics is a rigorous science with strong evidentiary procedures!
* However... We are trying to solve real life problems!
   * Need to be flexible and evolve to meet operational challenges
   * Scale, resourcing and time are critical challenges

> Triage is a pragmatic tradeoff between time and accuracy

<!-- .slide: class="content" -->

## This was 20 years ago!
### Could we do the same today?

* Unlikely to be very effective!
   * Modern devices don't generally have DVD drives
   * Full Disk Encryption is widely available
   * Trusted boot, protected BIOS to prevent booting into DVD
   * Many devices are hardened (e.g. Chromebooks)
   * Modern drives are huge

* Bad actors have better Op Sec
   * Much more awareness of DF techniques
   * Widely available encryption and security products

## Is Digital Forensics Dead?

* Constant tension between User Privacy vs. Digital Forensics!

   * Much of the time DF undermines device security.
   * Device manufacturers now focus on security and privacy as a first
     class feature.

* For example:
   * Full disk encryption
   * Incognito browsers
   * VPN and TLS everywhere!

## Triage is useful!

* Digital Forensics is about capturing the best available evidence
  * As long as general principals are followed it is useful!
     * What is appropriate for this evidence?

<img src="Hannahs_case_3.png" style="height: 280px">

---

<!-- .slide: class="content" -->

## Wider application of Digital Forensics

* Digital Forensics started off as a Law Enforcement tool.

    * Valuable tool to "determine what happened"

* Incident Response is a more modern application of DF techniques

    * Initially DF was used hoping for prosecution
       * Preserving evidence to evidentiary standards
       * Shipping drives via FedEx!
       * Thorough analysis and reporting by DFIR experts

---

<!-- .slide: class="content" -->

## Priority of DFIR

* As adversaries became more professional they became more efficient

   * Financially motivated! Can cause a lot of damage

   * Time to dwell is measured in days and hours

   * No time to take full disk images!

* We need to rely more on triage!

   * Faster turn around - we need answers quickly!

   * Main goal is disruption and eviction of attackers.

## Is Digital Forensics Good enough?

* Many of the traditional Digital Forensics artifacts are not
  specifically designed for our needs.

* For example:
   * Prefetch files
      * Evidence of execution
   * Jumplists
      * Evidence of user actions
   * USB device insertion
      * Various registry keys

---

<!-- .slide: class="content" -->

## Other challenges

* Use of TRIM in physical drives make slack analysis useless!

* Operating systems are becoming hardened!
   * MacOS System Integrity Protections means we can not access some files.
   * Chromebooks anyone?
   * Ipads?

---

<!-- .slide: class="content" -->

## Sometimes Digital Forensics is unsatisfying!

* Much of the time we arrive at the "crime scene" after the fact

* Try to reconstruct what happened from incidental information

* Forensics by its nature is **Making the best of a bad hand!**

---

<!-- .slide: class="title" -->

<div style="height: 100px"></div>

## If we rely on Digital Forensics, we have already lost!

### Digital Forensics is reactive in nature

* In a perfect world we would not need Digital Forensics!

---

<!-- .slide: class="content" -->

## What if we could prepare for forensics?

* Sometimes we go into an incident unprepared, but a lot of the time
  we can prepare in advance!

  * In a corporate setting we can actually prepare for forensic
    investigation and incident response

  * Similar but orthogonal to system hardening

>  Taking steps in advance to increase our chances of successfully
>  investigating an incident!

## Forensic Readiness

1. Maximizing an environment's ability to collect credible digital
   evidence
2. Minimizing the cost of forensics in an incident response.

[Forensic Readiness John Tan @Stake (2001)](https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.480.6094&rep=rep1&type=pdf)

<!-- .slide: class="content" -->

## Levels of preparedness

* Information security is a continuum and a tradeoff between
  resourcing and usability

* What can we do to improve our forensic readiness?

  * Simple things can be done cheaply!
     * Set configuration parameters in the environment.

  * More sophisticated things may involve more efforts
     * Install an agent, EDR etc.

* Consider how likely a forensic investigation will occur?
  * Tradeoff between cost and completeness
  * Table top exercises!

---

<!-- .slide: class="content" -->

## What types of interventions can we employ?

* Configuration change
  * Increases the system's ability to support forensic analysis

* Installation of EDR/Agents/Endpoint visibility software
  * Increases resilience against malicious anti-forensics.

---

<!-- .slide: class="content" -->

## Reimagine the forensic process

* Let's re-examine the digital forensic process critically

* Identify the things that can go wrong, the gaps and improvements

* Can we increase our chances of success?
   * Passive target: No deliberate interference with the DFIR process
   * Active Adversary: Employing Anti-Forensics to frustrate investigation

## Event logs

<img src="account_activity.png" style="height: 400px;">

---

<!-- .slide: class="content" -->

## Event logs

* Event logs are a huge source of forensic information!
* But they have some problems:

  * Rotation of event logs. By default event log size is very small
      (20 mb)
  * We can adjust the maximum size of log files through group policy
    or the registry.

---

<!-- .slide: class="content" -->

## Setting event log size

<img src="gpo_event_logs.png">

---

<!-- .slide: class="content" -->

## Clearing the event logs

* Many attackers clear the event logs to frustrate forensic analysis.
   * Use Volume Shadow copies to periodically snapshot the disk
   * Forward events off the system, e.g. for SIEM or even built in
     Event Log forwarding.
   * Detect event log configuration modifications (Registry changes)

---

<!-- .slide: class="content" -->

## Forwarding event logs off the system

* The best practice for protecting event logs is to forward them off
  the system.

   * Built in facility within Windows: [Windows Event Forwarding (WEF)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/use-windows-event-forwarding-to-assist-in-intrusion-detection?source=recommendations)

   * Use agent like Elastic or Velociraptor

* Tuning which events to forward
  * Sending only relevant events means less volume
  * Indexing events on the server side may increase costs (can just
    forward for backup).

---

<!-- .slide: class="full_screen_diagram" -->

## Example: Forwarding Sysmon logs

---

<!-- .slide: class="content" -->

## Disabling of event logs

* Attackers can actively change logging configuration

<img src="disable-bits-log.png" style="height: 400px;">

---

<!-- .slide: class="content" -->

## What can we do with an agent?

* We can constantly check configuration for compliance

## What can we do with an agent?

* Real time alerting on configuration modifications

## Filesystem artifacts: USN

* The USN Journal records filesystem operations

   * Operations are recorded in the hidden NTFS file `$Extend\$UsnJrnl:$J`

   * The USN journal rolls over fairly quickly (Approx 30mb)

---

<!-- .slide: class="content" -->

## Using the USN journal in IR

Filtering the USN journal for prefetch file modifications gives
useful timestamps related to program execution!

<img src="usn_filter_for_pf.png" style="height: 300px;">

---

<!-- .slide: class="content" -->

## Querying the USN journal

* The [fsutil tool](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/fsutil-usn) can be used to manipulate the USN journal.

<!-- .slide: class="content" -->

## Attackers may clear the USN journal

* Attacker can completely delete the USN Journal.

* We are forced to carve the disk for USN records!

<img src="carving_usn.png" style="height: 300px;">

---

<!-- .slide: class="content" -->

## What can we do with an agent?

* Forward USN records off the system in a timely fashion.

## Conclusions

* Digital Forensics is actually a rapidly evolving field!

* Although rooted in "Best Practice" and "Court Admissibility"
   * Don't worry about being pragmatic.
   * Sometimes it is impossible to get the evidence in the traditional way.
   * We need to be creative to make use of the best evidence we have.
   * No gatekeeping ! Be inclusive !

---

<!-- .slide: class="content" -->

## Conclusions

* Digital forensics is the best we have when preparation is
  insufficient!

* We can do some simple and easy things to improve our forensic
  preparedness.

* Challenge ourselves to preempt the forensic process
  * Table top exercises
  * Consider possible investigations
     * What forensic artifact is **best** to answer our questions?
